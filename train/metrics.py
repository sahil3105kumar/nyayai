span-level precision/recall/F1 via seqeval, wired into HF Trainer's
compute_metrics callback.

seqeval scores whole ENTITIES (e.g. a 3-token B-CITE/I-CITE/I-CITE span
counts as one correct/incorrect unit), not individual tokens - token-level
accuracy would look artificially high here since the vast majority of
tokens are "O" in any real document.

the part worth being careful about: predictions and labels both come in
padded to the batch's max length, with -100 at every position that isn't a
real word's first subword (see dataset.py). those positions have to be
stripped BEFORE handing anything to seqeval - seqeval has no concept of
"ignore this token," so a stray -100 would either crash it or, worse,
silently get decoded as whatever ID2LABEL.get(-100) returns.
