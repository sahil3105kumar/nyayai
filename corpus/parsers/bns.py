"""
BNS parser. fully self-contained - no shared base class or inheritance
with any other act's parser (see issue #26). BNS is a brand-new act
(2023, in force from 2024) with almost none of IPC's 160 years of
amendment scar tissue, so its real PDF is a lot cleaner than IPC's - but
"cleaner" doesn't mean "identical", and a couple of its own quirks still
needed empirical fixing (see below). this file doesn't reuse IPC's
regexes as-is for that reason - same *approach* (TOC as ground truth),
different patterns tuned against BNS's own PDF.

page extraction and running-header stripping are shared plumbing, not
act-specific grammar, so they still come from corpus/pdf_utils.py rather
than being reimplemented here - same reasoning as IPC's parser.

what the real PDF actually looks like, verified against the real file
(corpus/sources/bns/, "[As on the 6th October, 2025]" edition):

  - it opens with a cover page, an abbreviations page, then a ~13-page
    table of contents (ARRANGEMENT OF SECTIONS) - same shape as IPC's,
    section number + title with NO trailing dash, which is what makes
    TOC entries hard to tell apart from real section starts by regex
    alone (hence the TOC-guided approach, same as IPC).
  - section numbers run 1-358 with NO gaps and NO letter suffixes at all
    - verified by diffing the full number sequence against range(1, 359).
    makes sense: this is the first edition of a new act, there's been no
    amendment cycle yet to insert/repeal anything.
  - almost no amendment-history noise: the entire document has exactly
    ONE footnote in it (marking the 1-July-2024 commencement date on
    section 1) and exactly ONE bracket pair in the whole body (the
    enactment date "[25th December, 2023.]"). corpus/pdf_utils.py now
    resolves each in-body footnote marker to the actual footnote sentence
    it denotes (pulled from that page's own footnote-definition block),
    wrapped in {curly braces} to differentiate from normal [] brackets.
    so the shape becomes: "on such date{1st day of July, 2024, except...}"
    - confirmed end-to-end against a real generated PDF exercising this
    shape. the optional footnote-prefix patterns below are written to
    match {footnote text} format.
  - BUT: two sections break the otherwise-uniform "number. Title.—Body"
    format, found by running IPC's original template against the real
    text and checking what didn't match:
      * section 217 has no period before its dash ("...to injury of
        another person—Whoever gives...") - title runs straight into a
        single dash with nothing separating them.
      * section 255 has its dash immediately after the number
        ("255.—Public servant disobeying...") rather than after the
        title - the title itself is followed by a second, ordinary
        dash before the body. so the shape is "N.—Title.—Body" instead
        of "N. Title.—Body" for this one section.
    both are handled by making the pre-title dash optional and the
    post-title period optional in the candidate pattern, rather than
    hand-carving a special case for two section numbers.
  - the TOC has its own page-break noise: a bare page-number line (e.g.
    "\n11\n") sometimes lands in the middle of a wrapped title, and the
    running "SECTIONS" header repeats at the top of most TOC pages. the
    original single-line IPC-style TOC regex doesn't reproduce this,
    because unlike IPC's title text, some BNS titles wrap across a page
    boundary rather than just a line break, and the page-break debris
    sits between the wrapped halves.
  - after section 358 ("Repeal and savings") the document keeps going
    into a "STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS" section, which is not Act
    text - has to be excluded or section 358 silently swallows it as
    its own body.

approach: same TOC-guided idea as IPC - walk the TOC in order, and for
each expected number, search FORWARD from a monotonically-advancing
cursor for a candidate matching that exact number. see ipc.py for the
full rationale on why this beats a generic "find every candidate, then
align" pass. verified end to end against the real PDF: all 358 of 358
TOC entries find a body match, in order, with sane boundaries.

#   - an optional period before the final dash, to cover section 217's
