"""
groups LineSpans into chunks that InLegalBERT can consume.

InLegalBERT (like all BERT models) has a hard 512 subword token limit.
a legal document can have hundreds of lines so we need to:
  1. pack lines into chunks that stay under 512 tokens
  2. keep a mapping from each token position back to its source LineSpan
     so postprocess.py can recover the bbox when a label is assigned

the token->span mapping is the critical piece. without it we'd know
"token 47 is a CITE error" but have no idea where on the page it is.
